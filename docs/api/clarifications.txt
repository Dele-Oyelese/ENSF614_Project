Currently the backend has the following model items:
	- BoxOffice
	- Movie
	- RegisteredUser
	- Seat
	- Ticket
	
	* have we combined user and registereduser into one class?
		* initial document specifies two types of "User", may need to have 3 classes
		* may need to apply some fancy design patterns to implement this under a generic
		  "user" class
